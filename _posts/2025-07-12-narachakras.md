Nara loved her Mamami's house. It smelled like cinnamon and old books, and sunshine always seemed to find its way through the windows, even on cloudy days. But the best thing about her Mamami was the sparkle in her eyes, a little twinkle that made Nara feel like magic was real.

One sunny afternoon, as they sat in the garden surrounded by buzzing bees and colorful flowers, Nara asked, "Mamami, why do you always seem so happy and calm?"

Mamami smiled, her eyes twinkling brighter than ever. "That, my little sprout," she said, tapping a finger on Nara's forehead, "is because of my rainbow lights. And guess what? You have them too."

Nara giggled. "Rainbow lights? Inside me? Where?"

"All along your spine, like a secret ladder of sparkling jewels," Mamami whispered. "They are called chakras, and they help you be strong, creative, loving, and wise. The first one is at the very bottom of your spine, and itâ€™s a beautiful, glowing red, like a ripe strawberry. This is your **Root Chakra**."

Mamami told Nara to take off her shoes and press her bare feet into the soft grass. "Imagine roots growing from your feet, deep, deep into the warm earth," she said. "This red light helps you feel safe and strong, like a big old tree."

Nara closed her eyes and imagined it. A warm, steady feeling spread up from her feet, and she felt as solid and calm as the ancient oak tree at the end of the garden. She could do anything!

The next day, Nara was trying to draw a picture of her cat, Mittens, but she couldn't get the orange stripes right. She huffed in frustration.

Mamami came over and gave her a gentle hug. "It sounds like your orange light needs a little polish," she said. "Just below your belly button is your **Sacral Chakra**. It glows a bright, happy orange, like a juicy peach, and it's where all your creativity lives."

Mamami put on some music and told Nara to forget about drawing and just dance. As Nara swirled and twirled, she imagined a warm, orange light spinning in her tummy. When she went back to her paper, her hand moved effortlessly. She wasn't just drawing Mittens; she was painting with swirls of orange and yellow, creating the most vibrant, playful cat she had ever seen. She had created something extraordinary!

A few days later, Nara was nervous about her first day at swim class. Her tummy felt fluttery and wobbly. She told her Mamami she was too scared to go.

Mamami knelt and placed a warm hand on Nara's belly. "Right here," she said softly, "is a little ball of sunshine. It's your **Solar Plexus Chakra**, and it glows a brilliant yellow. This is where your courage lives."

She told Nara to take a deep breath and imagine that yellow light getting bigger and brighter, filling her whole body with warmth and confidence. Nara took a deep breath, and then another. The wobbles in her tummy turned into a steady, warm hum. When she got to the pool, she remembered her inner sunshine and jumped into the water with a brave splash!

The most magical thing happened the following week. While hugging her Mamami goodnight, Nara saw a soft, green glow all around her.

"I see it, Mamami! I see your sparkle!" Nara exclaimed.

Mamami laughed. "Ah, you've opened your **Heart Chakra**," she said, placing her hand over Nara's heart. "It glows with a beautiful green light, the color of new leaves in spring. It's where all your love comes from. When you feel love for someone, you can see their love shining right back at you."

From then on, Nara started seeing soft, colorful lights around everyone. She saw a gentle green around her mom when she tucked her in, a bright, happy yellow around her friends when they played, and a calm, steady red around her dad when he held her hand.

Mamami taught her about the other lights, too. The **Throat Chakra**, a clear blue like the sky, which helped her tell her stories and sing her songs. The **Third Eye Chakra**, a deep indigo like the night, right between her eyebrows, which helped her trust her feelings and know things without being told. Once, she knew her mom had lost her keys and found them under the sofa, just by closing her eyes and "looking" with her special spot.

And finally, the **Crown Chakra**, a shimmering, violet-white light at the very top of her head, like a sparkling crown. "This," Mamami said, "connects you to everything. To the stars, the sun, the flowers, and to everyone you love."


Sometimes, Nara and her Mamami would sit quietly together, imagining all their rainbow lights glowing brightly, from the steady red at their feet to the sparkling violet at their heads. In those moments, Nara felt connected to the whole wide world. She knew she wasn't just a little girl; she was a rainbow of light, full of courage, creativity, and love. And that was the most extraordinary thing of all.
